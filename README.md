This subject emphasizes on 8051 MicroController and MSP432.

It teaches basic concepts of I2C, SPI communication. 

There are labs which comprises of buffer creation , adding memory to the buffer, deleting memory from buffer and also teaches the concept of DMA.

In lab 4, we interfaced LCD 16x2 and displayed custom characters in it.

The whole board comprises of power supply unit (converting 9v to 5v), that 5v being supplied to the micro controller with some decoupling capacitors attached around it.

External RAM is being attached to the micro controller. Using this RAM , codes are written to transfer memory into the external location and retrieve memory back from that location

UART is configured with the 8051 Microcontroller to understand the concepts of serial communication

DAC and ADC is implemented through SPI communication and outputs are measured on Oscilloscopes

On MSP432, temperature measurement through ADC is implemented. Encryption of message and Decryption of message method is implemented.

We were taught to use Logic Port Analyzer and check the output signals of 8051 and also MSP432 as a part of debugging techniques.

All the components on board were soldered by hand with good wire wrapping techniques.
